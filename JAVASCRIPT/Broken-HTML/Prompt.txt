Refactor a responsive 3-card product gallery into a reusable component-based structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

✅ Requirements:

Fix any layout or responsiveness issues (e.g., card widths on small screens, alignment, padding/margin bugs).

Use clean, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code — remove repetitive HTML by generating cards dynamically in JavaScript.

Convert each product card into a reusable Card({title, price, description, image}) function or class that renders into the DOM.

Maintain the theme toggle (light/dark) and the fade-in animation on cards.

Ensure cards are responsive (3 on desktop, 1 on mobile) and hover interactions remain intact.

Make the structure easy to scale with 5+ products by just updating the data array.
